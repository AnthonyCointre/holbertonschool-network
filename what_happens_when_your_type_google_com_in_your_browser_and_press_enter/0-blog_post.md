# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and hit Enter, a complex series of events takes place behind the scenes to deliver the content you requested. This journey involves various components of the web stack, each playing a crucial role. Below, we'll break down the process step by step.

## 1. DNS Request
The first thing that happens is a DNS (Domain Name System) request. The DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. When you type a human-readable URL like www.google.com, your browser needs to translate that into an IP address (a numerical label like 172.217.3.110) that servers use to identify each other.

Here’s how it works:
- Your browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for www.google.com. If it does, the DNS lookup is skipped.
- If not, the request goes to the operating system's DNS cache. If the IP isn’t found there, the request is forwarded to a DNS resolver, often provided by your ISP.
- The DNS resolver queries a root DNS server, which directs it to a TLD (Top-Level Domain) server, like .com, which then directs it to Google's authoritative DNS server.
- Finally, the resolver receives the IP address for www.google.com and returns it to your browser.

## 2. TCP/IP Connection
Now that your browser has the IP address, it needs to establish a connection with Google's server. This is where TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) comes into play.
- TCP Handshake: Your browser initiates a TCP handshake, which is a three-step process to establish a reliable connection:
    - SYN: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
    - SYN-ACK: The server acknowledges with a SYN-ACK packet.
    - ACK: Your browser responds with an ACK packet, establishing the connection.
- IP Layer: The data packets are then sent over the internet using IP, which routes them through various network nodes until they reach Google's server.

## 3. Firewall
During this process, firewalls on both the client and server sides may inspect the traffic to ensure it’s legitimate. Firewalls are security systems that block or allow traffic based on predefined security rules. If any part of the traffic looks suspicious, it might be blocked or flagged for further inspection.

## 4. HTTPS/SSL
Since you’re accessing Google using HTTPS, SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) comes into play. HTTPS ensures that the data transmitted between your browser and the server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdroppers.
- SSL Handshake: Before data can be sent securely, an SSL handshake occurs:
    - Browser Hello: Your browser sends a “hello” message to the server, which includes the SSL/TLS version and cipher suites it supports.
    - Server Hello: The server responds with its own “hello,” choosing the SSL/TLS version and cipher suite to use.
    - Certificate: The server sends its SSL certificate, which includes the server’s public key. Your browser checks this certificate against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
    - Session Key: If the certificate is valid, your browser generates a session key, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it back to the server.
    - Secure Connection: Both parties now use the session key to encrypt and decrypt data.

## 5. Load Balancer
Once the connection is secure, the request reaches Google’s infrastructure, where a load balancer comes into play. A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- The load balancer examines the request and forwards it to one of Google's many web servers. This decision can be based on various factors, such as server load, geographic location, or health checks.

## 6. Web Server
The web server is responsible for handling HTTP(S) requests. It processes the incoming request and decides how to respond. In this case, it might serve static content directly (like images or HTML files) or forward the request to an application server for more complex processing.

## 7. Application Server
The application server is where the dynamic content is generated. For example, if you were searching for something on Google, the application server would handle the search logic.
- The application server queries databases, processes data, and applies business logic to generate the content you see on your screen.

## 8. Database
Finally, the application server may need to fetch data from a database. Databases are used to store and retrieve large amounts of structured data. For example, Google’s search index is stored in a massive distributed database.
- The application server queries the database, retrieves the necessary data, and then uses that data to construct the web page you requested.

## Conclusion
Once all these steps are complete, the data is sent back through the same path: from the application server to the web server, through the load balancer, over the secure HTTPS connection, back through the internet, and finally to your browser.

Your browser then takes this data, typically in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders it on your screen, turning it into the interactive page you see.

This entire process, which involves DNS resolution, TCP/IP connections, firewalls, SSL encryption, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases, happens in mere milliseconds, delivering a seamless experience every time you browse the web.
